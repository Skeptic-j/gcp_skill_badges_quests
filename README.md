# GCP-Qwiklabs-Quests
This is a repo for Qwiklab labs solutions & notes that I've personally attempted and noted down.

## Why write down everything again when most of the solutions are given in the guided labs?
1. I prefer to note down the solutions and my personal interpreted notes of labs attempted in GCP Qwiklabs Learning.

2. Going through the high level steps and writing it down before attempting the labs gives a clear image of what I'm about to do.

3. Serves also as a notebook through my personal learning journey attempting the GCP Quest's guided and challenge labs.

4. For attempting challenge labs, guided labs notes serves as references.
