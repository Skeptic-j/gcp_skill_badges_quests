# GCP-Qwiklabs-Quests
This is a repo for Qwiklab labs solutions & notes that I've personally attempted and setup in a lab environment.
These documentations are an interpreted shortened version of the given guided instructions in the lab.
Challenge labs are not guided and are attempted by myself with some references from offical manuals and other lab references.

## Other motivation for creating this repo
1. Keeping reference to labs attempted in GCP Qwiklabs Learning.

2. Helps with learning. Going through the high level steps and writing it down before attempting the labs gives a clear image of what I'm about to do.

3. Practice writing manuals and documentations for setups.
